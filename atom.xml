设置每个切片的时长为5秒，你可以根据需要进行调整。</li><li><code>-hls_list_size 0</code>: 设置.m3u8播放列表的大小，0表示不限制大小。</li><li><code>-hls_segment_filename index%3d.ts</code>: 设置.ts切片文件的命名规则。</li></ul><p>切片完成后，将生成的.m3u8和.ts文件保存到一个文件夹中，以便后续管理。</p><h3 id="步骤-4-将切片上传到GitHub仓库"><a href="#步骤-4-将切片上传到GitHub仓库" class="headerlink" title="步骤 4: 将切片上传到GitHub仓库"></a>步骤 4:
